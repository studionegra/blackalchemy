Auto-generating choreographed motion and virtual worlds using sentiment analysis. 

**O V E R V I E W **

Black Alchemy is a collaboration between Studio Negra, founded by Jaycee Holmes, and T Lang, of T Lang Dance. Black Alchemy is a virtual experience, intended for Web or VR headset, that auto-generates choreographed motion and visual elements using sentiment analysis. This project has two phases. 

**PHASE I **

Phase I focuses on the mapping of Black sentiment to choreographed movement using the Emotion Wheels originally developed by psychologist Robert Plutchik and then expanded upon by the Juno Institute. Custom Black avatars (‘spirits’), created for this experience, will embody this mapping in the virtual space. 

**PHASE II **

Phase II introduces the poetry and linguistic work of Black femmes throughout  history. Expanding on the work of Phase I, sentiment analysis will detect the emotion of various poetry to create a body of movement
